# Mail-QA
- Mail QA is an innovative chat-based platform, that utilizes the power of generative AI to provide users with effortless access to all their emails and files/company data shared in the workspace.

## The Problem
- From a report by [Mckinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy), employees across various sectors reported spending an increasing amount of time sorting through emails and gathering information, leading to a noticeable decline in overall workplace productivity.

## Why we need to solve it?
- Efficient email and company data management is crucial for boosting productivity, enhancing employee engagement, and improving work quality across diverse industries
 
- Addressing this inefficiency prevents valuable time diversion from critical tasks, reduces demotivation, and lowers turnover rates. 

- The impact extends to sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and technology, where timely decision-making and operational efficiency are paramount.


## Key Features
- Instant access to userâ€™s emails : Access all email content, retrieve unread emails, search for specific emails, summarize email threads, and generate responses using natural language prompts.
- Instant access to data shared in the workspace: Access any pdf, word, txt document shared in the workspace using natural language prompts.
- Multilingual support: Emails and files shared can be translated into 98 other languages supported by the OpenAI API useful for multi-region organizations. 
- Multi-platform: Currently the app is available on Slack but will soon be available to users on Microsoft Teams offering the same functionality.
